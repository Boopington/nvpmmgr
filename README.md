This program lets you easily edit and reload "PowerMizer" settings as well as disabling the automatic Core Slowdown on GPU temp. "PowerMizer" mixed with the "PerfLevelSrc" (both set by this program) is the exact same setup that EVGA's KBoost utilizes to prevent the huge clock fluctuations introduced by GPU Boost 3.0. In my experience, disabling any kind of clock fluctuations (including Intel's Speedstep/TurboBoost technology) results in a dramatic reduction in frame time hitches in games.
